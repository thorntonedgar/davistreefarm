Financing & Payback Plan

## Phased Financing Approach
The business will be developed in three phases, with financing and risk managed at each stage.

### Phase 1: Outdoor-Only Launch (Lean MVP)
- **Estimated Cost:** $200,000–$400,000
- **Funding Source:** HELOC (secured by existing property)
- **Interest Rate:** 12% (variable)
- **Loan Term:** 10 years
- **Monthly Payment:** 
  - Draw Period (Years 1-3): $1,666 (Interest Only)
  - Amortization Period (Years 4-10): $2,381 (Principal + Interest)
- Start with 10-20 events per year ($4k per event - $2k in costs per event)
- Goal is to break even this first year and prove demand before major borrowing


- **Notes:** Lower risk, quick launch to prove demand before major borrowing. Minimal debt service in early years.

### Phase 2: Permanent Core Infrastructure
- **Estimated Cost:** $400,000–$800,000
- **Funding Sources:** SBA 7(a) or 504 loan (based on Phase 1 bookings and cash flow)
- **Notes:** Larger loan only pursued if Phase 1 shows demand. Debt service increases, but so does revenue capacity.

### Phase 3: Indoor Barn / Event Center Buildout
- **Estimated Cost:** $800,000–$1,200,000
- **Funding Sources:** Refinancing, higher revenue from add-ons, outside investors, or additional loans
- **Notes:** Major expansion for year-round operations. Should be timed after successful ramp-up and strong bookings.

## Example Financing Structure
- **Initial Phase 1 Loan (if needed):** $250,000 at 7% over 10 years = ~$35,000/year
- **Phase 2 SBA Loan:** $600,000 at 7% over 20 years = ~$56,000/year
- **Phase 3 Loan/Refinance:** $1,000,000 at 7% over 20 years = ~$94,000/year (only if justified by cash flow)

## Payback & Profitability
- **Staged investment reduces risk**—major debt only taken on after demand is proven.
- **Annual profit after debt service and taxes** will vary by phase:
  - Early years: modest profit, focus on ramping up bookings
  - After Phase 2: higher profit, improved cash flow
  - After Phase 3: maximum capacity, highest profit potential
- **Effective tax rate:** 25% on profits (LLC pass-through)

## Key Considerations
- Each phase should be validated by bookings and cash flow before proceeding to the next.
- Maintain contingency funds for overruns or slower-than-expected ramp-up.
- Work with a lender familiar with agri-tourism and event venues.

**Summary:**
This phased approach allows for lean startup, risk management, and scaling investment with demonstrated demand. Major long-term borrowing is only pursued after successful proof of concept.
