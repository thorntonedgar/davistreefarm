Legal Structure & Considerations

Business Structure:
- The business will be organized as an LLC (Limited Liability Company) with pass-through taxation.
- This structure protects owners' personal assets from business liabilities and allows business income to be taxed once at the owner level (no corporate tax).
- LLCs offer flexible management and are commonly used for family-owned venues.

Key Legal Steps:
- Register LLC with the state
- Obtain necessary business licenses and permits (zoning, health, alcohol if applicable)
- Secure liability and property insurance
- Draft/review contracts for clients, vendors, and employees
- Comply with ADA and local accessibility requirements
- Maintain proper bookkeeping and tax filings

**Notes:**
- Pass-through taxation means profits/losses are reported on the ownersâ€™ personal tax returns.
- Consult an attorney/CPA to ensure compliance with local laws and for help with LLC operating agreements.
