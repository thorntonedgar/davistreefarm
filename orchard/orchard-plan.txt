Orchard & Landscaping Plan

## Property Overview
- Total property: ~14 acres
- Orchard area: 4 acres (dedicated to fruit production and event integration)
- Additional trees for decoration/privacy: Planted along venue boundaries, driveways, and key event areas

## Goals
- Plant a diverse orchard (apples, cherries, pears, persimmons) to enhance the landscape, provide seasonal beauty, and supply fruit for marketing, décor, and small-batch products (cider, preserves, etc.)
- Use additional trees and landscaping for privacy screening, windbreaks, and beautification throughout the property
- Integrate orchard and landscaping into the overall guest experience for weddings and events

## Tree Selection & Quantities (Example)
- Orchard block (4 acres):
  - Apples: 80 trees
  - Cherries: 40 trees
  - Pears: 30 trees
  - Persimmons: 20 trees
  - Total orchard trees: ~170
- Decorative/privacy trees (around venue, drive, boundaries):
  - Mix of fruit, flowering, and evergreen trees: 60–80 trees
- Grand total: ~230–250 new trees

## Site Preparation & Planting
- Soil testing and amendment: $5,000
- Land clearing, grading, and layout: $10,000
- Tree purchase (bare root, 2-3 year old): $85/tree x 240 = $20,400
- Planting labor: $5,000
- Initial irrigation system (4 acres + decorative): $15,000
- Deer/rabbit fencing (4 acres + privacy zones, ~2,000 linear feet): $18,000

## Landscaping & Event Integration
- Pathways, seating, and lighting: $18,000
- Decorative plantings (flowers, shrubs, groundcover): $12,000

## Equipment & Annual Care
- Small tractor/mower: $15,000 (one-time)
- Tools, sprayers, ladders: $4,000 (one-time)
- Annual maintenance (fertilizer, pruning, pest management): $7,000/year

## Fruit Use
- Fruit used for on-site décor, guest gifts, and small-batch cider/jam for marketing
- Not intended as a major profit center, but enhances brand and guest experience

## Timeline
- Year 1: Site prep, planting, initial landscaping
- Years 2-3: Trees establish, limited fruit, develop event integration
- Years 4-5+: First significant harvests, full integration with venue events

## Rough Total Initial Investment
- Orchard & landscaping establishment: ~$100,000–$120,000 (excludes ongoing annual care)

**Notes:**
- Adjust tree count and layout to fit property and event flow
- Consult local extension service or orchard expert for best varieties and planting practices
- Plan for irrigation and fencing to ensure early success
- Consider evergreens and flowering trees for year-round privacy and aesthetics
