**Notes:**
- Septic costs are highly variable and should be confirmed with a local engineer based on soil and code.
- These are high-level estimates. Actual costs may vary widely by region, design, and materials.
- Excludes land acquisition, major utility upgrades beyond septic, permits/fees, and contingency.
- Get multiple quotes from local builders for accuracy.

Financing & Payback Estimate:

- Assumed buildout loan: $1,500,000 (midpoint of estimate)
- Interest rate (SBA loan): 7%
- Loan term: 20 years 

Annual loan payment (20 years): ~$124,000

Projected annual profit (full ramp): $226,500

Profit After Debt Service and Taxes:
- Pre-tax profit after loan payment: $226,500 - $124,000 = $102,500
- Estimated taxes (25%): $25,625
- Net profit after taxes and loan payment: $76,875

Payback Analysis:
- Year 1: 40% of profit ($90,600) — may not cover loan payment, may require interest-only or deferred payments
- Year 2: 80% of profit ($181,200) — covers payment, some cash flow margin
- Year 3+: 100% of profit ($226,500) — covers payment, positive net profit

Estimated payback period (ignoring interest):
- $1,500,000 / $226,500 ≈ 6.6 years

With loan interest:
- Full loan repaid after 20 years of payments (standard amortizing schedule)
- Real “payback” from profits: 7–10 years, depending on ramp-up, cash reserves, and reinvestment

**Notes:**
- Early years may require additional working capital or interest-only loan structure
- Actual terms and rates will depend on lender, credit, and collateral
- Consider building in a cash cushion for slow ramp or unforeseen expenses
- Tax rate is an estimate; consult an accountant for your specific scenario
